 ----------
 A coffebreak roguelike created for the 7DRL Challenge 2012 (in ~63h of realtime).

 You are a Grey Warden at the end of your days. As countless others before you,
 you step into the Deep Roads to take on your last quest - to destroy
 as many darkspawn as you can before collapsing to blows or the corruption
 that is running in your veins.
 The game is (as may be obvious to some) based on the fluff from
    Dragon Age: Origins by BioWare.

 ----------

 dependencies: SDL

 The objectives:
 - Seek out blade shards to gain access to the lower levels!
 - Reforge an ancient sword!
 - Kill the Archdemon on level 10!
 - Beat the highscore!

 Some tips:
 - Walk into things to attack
 - Your stamina drains quickly in combat and while waiting,
     only killing monsters can replenish it with your rage
 - If you run out of power, you are dead
 - You can't kill the Archdemon without a powerful sword
 - Find health potions to regain some lost strength
 - Only cardinal directions are valid for movement
