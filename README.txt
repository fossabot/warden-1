 ----------
 A coffebreak roguelike created for the 7DRL Challenge 2012 (in ~63h of realtime).

 You are a Grey Warden at the end of your days. As countless others before you,
 you step into the Deep Roads to take on your last quest - to destroy
 as many darkspawn as you can before collapsing to blows or the corruption
 that is running in your veins.
 The game is (as may be obvious to some) based on the fluff from
    Dragon Age: Origins by BioWare.

 ----------
 HOW TO RUN:

 Windows:
 run warden_win.bat

 Linux / MacOSX:
 dependencies: SDL

 run warden_linux.sh

 ----------
 Keybindings:

 Arrows / numpad / vi-keys   -   Arrows / numpad arrows / vi-keys
 TAB                         -   Cycle interesting things on screen
 Point with mouse            -   Display names of objects
 F1                          -   Display help screen
 F11                         -   Toggle fullscreen
 SHIFT + Q                   -   Exit to main menu (no saving!)
 SHIFT + P                   -   Take a screenshot

 ----------
 The objectives:
 - Gain as many points as possible by killing monsters and descending
 - Seek out blade shards to gain access to the lower levels of the dungeon
 - Kill the Archdemon on level 10
 - Beat the highscore!

 Main mechanics:
 - Walk into things to attack (original idea! honest!)
 - Your stamina drains quickly in combat and while waiting,
     only killing monsters can replenish it with your rage
 - Find health potions to regain some lost strength
 - Only cardinal directions are valid for movement
